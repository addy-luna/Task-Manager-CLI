# To-Do CLI Tool with Node.js and MongoDB

Welcome to the To-Do CLI Tool repository! This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Node.js, designed to manage your to-do tasks efficiently. It utilizes MongoDB as the database to store all your to-dos securely. Additionally, we make use of several helpful npm packages to enhance the functionality and user experience of the tool.

We leverage the following npm packages to power various aspects of the To-Do CLI Tool:

-   **commander:**  
    This package helps us build the CLI tool by providing a framework for defining commands and options.
    
-   **chalk:**  
    Chalk makes messages in the terminal colorful and easy to read, enhancing the overall user experience.
    
-   **inquirer:**  
    Inquirer simplifies user input by providing a powerful interface for prompting users and handling their responses.
    
-   **ora:**  
    Ora adds a touch of elegance to the terminal interface by displaying nice spinning animations, providing visual feedback to users during long-running tasks.
